# テモテへの手紙の著者は誰か？

原文: [Who was the author of 1 and 2 Timothy?](http://helpmewithbiblestudy.org/11Church/TeachWhoAuthor1_2Timothy.aspx)

<!-- <p>Critics began to question Paul’s authorship of the Pastoral Epistles (1 and 2 Timothy and Titus) early in
the nineteenth century with the rise of German literary criticism. Because
<a href="../21verses/1121.aspx" class="second">1 Timothy 2:8-15</a> places explicit restrictions on a woman’s
role in ministry, the controversy continues today especially by those who disagree with this perceived
inequality. These critics prefer to believe that 1 and 2 Timothy were not authored by the Apostle Paul, were
pious forgeries, and therefore, should not be part of the Bible. Is this true?</p> -->

牧会書簡（第一・第二テモテへの手紙とテトスへの手紙）の著者がパウロであることに高等批評が疑義を投げかけたのは19世紀初頭、ドイツの文芸批評（literary criticism）の興隆に伴って始まった。[第一テモテ2:8-15]()では明示的に牧会における女性の役割を制限しているので、とりわけこの箇所が女性差別であるとして異議を唱える人々によって今日でも議論は続いている。この批判に乗るなら、テモテの手紙の著者が使徒パウロでなく、信仰心に基づく捏造(pious forgeries)であり、したがって聖書の一部だとみなすべきではないと信じるほうが都合が良いのだ。だが、本当だろうか。

<!-- <h1>How tradition began</h1> -->
## 伝統はどうか

<!-- <p>With little written record, oral tradition established that Paul authored 1 and 2 Timothy, and this was
well known and universally recognized by the Church (Eusebius). Early theologians and writers who lived during
and were contemporary with the apostles or contemporary with Timothy (Clement of Rome, Ignatius, and Polycarp)
were familiar with the letters and accepted 1 and 2 Timothy as genuine letters from the apostle Paul. As further
evidence that their authorship was never in doubt, the Pastoral Epistles were found in the early Latin and
Syriac versions of the New Testament.</p>
<p class="indent1">Clement, the Bishop of Rome (100 A.D.), wrote a letter to the church of Corinth, which was
preserved and can be seen today.</p>
<p class="indent1">Ignatius, the Bishop of Antioch (67-110 A.D.), was the pupil and friend of the Apostle
John.</p>
<p class="indent1">Polycarp, the Bishop of Smyrna (69-156 A.D.), like Ignatius, was the pupil and friend of
the Apostle John.</p> -->

エウセビオスによると、書による記録はほとんどなく、口頭の伝承によりテモテの手紙の著者はパウロだと伝えられており、そのことは教会で広く知られていた。使徒やテモテたちと同時代に生きた初期の神学者と記者（ローマのクレメンス、イグナティオス、ポリカープ）はテモテの手紙をよく知っており、使徒パウロによる真性書簡であると考えていた。さらなる証拠が著者の正真性を疑っていなかったことを示している。牧会書簡は初期の新約聖書のラテン語訳やシリア版にも見られるのだ。

<!-- <p>Of the Church fathers, three were great scholars who wrote and cited the New Testament extensively.</p>
<p class="indent1">Iranaeus, the Bishop of Lyons (130-200 A.D.), was a pupil of Polycarp and Papias. Of his
works in possession, he made 1200 references to the New Testament, including the earliest quotations of 1 and
2 Timothy around 170 A.D. in his apologetic against Gnosticism.</p> -->

古代教父の中では新約聖書を広く引用した三人の人物がいる。

<!-- <p class="indent1">Tertullian (born about 150 A.D.) was the first Christian writer to write in Latin
and coin the phrase "New Testament". Trained as a lawyer, he was considered an "Apologetic Father" for
his vigorous defense of Christian doctrine against Greek philosophy and Hellenistic culture. Of his known
works, he made 2,500 references to the New Testament.</p>
<p class="indent2">In one of his works, Tertullian acknowledges that the Pastoral Epistles were written
by Paul to Timothy and Titus and expresses surprise that the heretic Marcion did not believed that the
Pastoral Epistles should be part of the canon. Marcion’s version of the canon, which he assembled around
140-150 A.D., only had Luke (which he heavily edited), and only ten of thirteen of Paul’s epistles; the
heretic omitted all of the Old Testament and 16 books (or 60%) of the New Testament.</p> -->
<!-- <p class="indent1">Clement, the Bishop of Alexandria (born about 165 A.D.) is considered, after Justin
and Irenaeus, to be the founder of Christian literature. Alexandria was renown in the ancient world for
its scholars, university, and library. Clement succeeded his teacher Pantaenus to be the head of the
famous Catechetical School of Alexandria, which would produce other great Christian writers such as Origen.</p>
<p class="indent2">Clement of Alexandria, notable for his expansive knowledge of classical and biblical
literature, cited more pagan and Christian authors than the work of any other ancient author. Of the
New Testament, he cites all of the books except Philemon, James, 2 Peter, 2 John and 3 John.</p> -->

<!-- <p>In light of how tradition was established, the claim of pious forgeries of 1 and 2 Timothy would
imply that the early church fathers were either at best duped or at worst conspirators of the forgeries,
and that the heretic Marcion was correct. What is the basis for the claim of pious forgeries?</p> -->

伝統の形成過程をみると、テモテへの手紙が信仰心に基づく捏造であるという主張は、古代教父たちが良く言えば偽物に騙され、悪く言えば捏造に加担し、異端のマルキオンが正しかったのだと含意している。信仰心に基づく捏造という主張の根拠を調べてみよう。

<p>The critical arguments can be categorized into 4 areas:</p>
<p class="indent1">1. <a href="#chronology">Chronology</a> – does the event of 1 Timothy correspond
with the chronology of Paul’s travels in the book of Acts?</p>
<p class="indent1">2. <a href="#literary">Literary Style</a> – does the literary style (vocabulary,
logic, structure, etc) match with Paul’s style of writing?</p>
<p class="indent1">3. <a href="TeachWhoAuthor1_2Timothy2.aspx">Ecclesiology</a> – does the church
structure found in the letter reflect the early first century Christian church?</p>
<p class="indent1">4. <a href="TeachWhoAuthor1_2Timothy2.aspx#theology">Theology</a> – does the letter
address a form of Gnosticism found only in the second century? Does the soteriology correspond to

<a href="TeachWhoAuthor1_2Timothy2.aspx#forgery">Pious Forgeries</a> – Was it possible for a forgery

</div>

<div class="idea" id="chronology">
<h1>The Problem of Chronology</h1>
<p>Critics charge that the book of Acts does not mention the situation where Paul goes to Macedonia
and leaves Timothy at Ephesus
(<a href="../21verses/1120.aspx" class="second">1 Tim 1:3</a>). With the belief that the chronological
references of 1 Timothy does not correspond with the book of Acts, critics have assumed that 1 & 2 Timothy
were written by a later author.</p>
</div>

<div class="idea">
<p>However critics have misunderstood the reason for Paul’s first imprisonment and assumed that he
was executed. This would have ended any chance of Paul going east; thus, he could not possibly write
1 Timothy. Biblical and extra-biblical evidence clearly suggest otherwise. 1 Timothy does not fit
within the chronology of Acts, because it took place after the end of Acts.</p>
<p class="indent1">At the conclusion of his third missionary journey, Paul had organized a relief fund
among the Gentile churches to help the poorer members of the Jerusalem church. He was returning to
Jerusalem with representatives of the Gentile churches carrying their respective donations
(<a href="../21verses/1038.aspx" class="second">Acts 20:17-36</a>,
<a href="../21verses/1061.aspx" class="second">Rom 15:25-32</a>). Shortly after his arrival in Jerusalem,
Paul was attacked by a Jewish mob and rescued by Roman soldiers
(<a href="../21verses/1039.aspx" class="second">Acts 21:26</a>-
<a href="../21verses/1040.aspx" class="second">22:1-30</a>-
<a href="../21verses/1041.aspx" class="second">23:10</a>). He was imprisoned at the Roman governor’s
headquarters in Caesarea for the next 2 years  (<a href="../21verses/1041.aspx" class="second">Acts 23:11</a>-
<a href="../21verses/1042.aspx" class="second">24:27</a>).</p>
<p class="indent1">In response to God’s prompting of "so you must witness at Rome also"
(<a href="../21verses/1041.aspx" class="second">Acts 23:11</a>), Paul exercises his privilege as a Roman
citizen and appealed to Caesar, which transferred his case to Rome. Paul was sent to Rome in 59 A.D. where
he spent 2 years under house arrest waiting for his case to be heard before the supreme tribunal
(<a href="../21verses/1043.aspx" class="second">Acts 25:1</a>-
<a href="../21verses/1044.aspx" class="second">26:1-32</a>-
<a href="../21verses/1045.aspx" class="second">27:1-44</a>-
<a href="../21verses/1046.aspx" class="second">28:31</a>).</p>
</div>

<div class="idea">
<p class="indent1">When Luke finished writing the book of Acts, he does not reveal what happened to
Paul’s case, and there is little information about the rest of Paul’s career. But there is implicit
evidence that Paul was released.</p>
<p class="indent2">1. Paul was innocent by all Roman officials up to this point.</p>
<p class="indent3">Paul was arrested to save him from a Jewish mob not from any legal offense.</p>
<p class="indent3">The Jews did not bring any charges or testify against Paul during his 2-year imprisonment
in Caesarea.</p>
<p class="indent3">At this time, Christianity was considered a part of Judaism and was not considered
an illegal or forbidden religion and therefore not an offense punishable by death.</p>
<p class="indent3">Agrippa and Festus believed that Paul did nothing wrong and would have been freed
had he not appealed to Caesar (<a href="../21verses/1044.aspx" class="second">Acts 26:30-32</a>).</p>
<p class="indent3">While in captivity, Paul expresses confidence in his release
(<a href="../21verses/1104.aspx" class="second">Phil 1:25</a>,
<a href="../21verses/1105.aspx" class="second">2:24</a>,
<a href="../21verses/1133.aspx" class="second">Philem 22</a>).</p>
<p class="indent2">2. Ancient tradition says that Paul did go to Spain as he intended
(<a href="../21verses/1061.aspx" class="second">Rom 15:24</a>).</p>
<p class="indent3">Clement of Rome wrote that <i>"Paul...preached in the East and the West, and won
noble renown for his faith. He taught righteousness to the whole world and went to the western limit.
He bore witness to the rulers, and then passed out of the world..."</i> (1 Clement 5:6-7)</p>
<p class="indent4">During the first and second century, a reference to the "western limit" always meant
Spain.</p>
<p class="indent3">In other extra-biblical sources, such as the Muratorian Fragment and Acts of Peter,
there are indications that Paul was released from prison.</p>
</div>

<div class="idea">
<p>It is believed that, upon his release, Paul resumed his missionary journeys for at least 3 more
years before being arrested, tried, condemned, and executed around 67 A.D. during the persecution of
Christians under the Roman emperor Nero. Marking Paul’s burial near the Basilica in Rome, a stone
inscription says "To Paul, Apostle and Martyr."</p>
<p>This means that there was enough time for Paul to go on a fourth missionary journey and pen his
Pastoral Epistles.</p>
</div>

<div class="idea">
<p>The critics’ contention of a problem of chronology is further eroded when evaluating the epistle
2 Corinthians, which is undisputedly a letter from Paul.
In <a href="../21verses/1089.aspx" class="second">2 Corinthians 11:23-27</a>, Paul mentions his
experience of frequent imprisonments, 5 whippings, 3 beatings with a rod, 1 stoning, and 3 shipwrecks;
all of which was not mentioned once in the book of Acts.</p>
</div>

<div class="idea" id="literary">
<h1>The Problem of Literary Style</h1>
<p>Critics have contended that the Pastoral Epistles were not authored by Paul, because the letters
lacked the typical vocabulary, grammatical phrases, and literary style of Paul’s other epistles. For
example:</p>
<p class="indent1">1 Timothy has 356 of 529 words, or 67%, that do not appear in ten of Paul’s letters,
including 96 hapax legomena (words that appear only once in the New Testament).</p>
<p class="indent2">Typical Pauline words used in ten of Paul’s letters are not found in 1 or 2 Timothy.</p>
<p class="indent2">1 and 2 Timothy also use different words than Paul’s other letters to say the same
thing.</p>
<p class="indent1">1 and 2 Timothy have grammatical forms, such as how definite articles, prepositions,
and conjunctions are used, that are unique to the Pastoral Epistles and lack grammatical forms typical
of Paul’s other ten epistles.</p>
<p class="indent1">The Pastoral Epistles lack the distinctive writing style of Paul. Many aspects of
his literary style, such as his use of prepositions and pronouns are absent; consequently, the tone
and character of the Pastoral Epistles are different from Paul’s other ten epistles.</p>
</div>

<div class="idea">
<p>However this evidence is hardly conclusive against Pauline authorship of the Pastoral Epistles.
It is less conclusive than the explicit evidence within the Pastoral Epistles themselves, which indicate
Paul as the author (<a href="../21verses/1120.aspx" class="second">1 Tim 1:1</a>,
<a href="../21verses/1126.aspx" class="second">2 Tim 1:1</a>,
<a href="../21verses/1130.aspx" class="second">Titus 1:1</a>).</p>
<p class="indent1">Evidence of non-Pauline vocabulary and frequent hapax legomena used to deny Pauline
authorship of the Pastoral Epistles does not hold up under closer examination.</p>
<p class="indent2">The biggest problem for critics is Paul’s use of amanuenses (secretaries) to write
his letters (i.e. <a href="../21verses/1062.aspx" class="second">Rom 16:22</a>).
Because it is unknown how the epistles were originally produced, the
contribution of the amanuenses to the original text is unknown. This makes it impossible to establish
what is typical Pauline vocabulary, grammatical structure, and literary style.</p>
<p class="indent3">During the first century, Greek secretaries functioned in a variety of ways as
directed by the author. Some secretaries took dictation from authors while others wrote their own
words to convey the thought of the author. In the case of the Pastoral Epistles, it has been postulated
that Luke was Paul’s amanuenses based two observations: 1)
<a href="../21verses/1129.aspx" class="second">2 Timothy 4:11</a> states that "Only Luke is
with me…" and 2) there are many similarities in vocabulary with Acts.</p>
</div>

<div class="idea">
<p class="indent2">In considering the literary evidence against Pauline authorship, most words missing
in the Pastoral Epistles are also absent in epistles that have been unquestionably established as
Paul’s. There is no even distribution of vocabulary throughout all of Paul’s epistles. Yet critics
never mention the inconsistent use of this type of evidence to condemn the Pastoral Epistles or
disqualify those epistles unquestionably Paul’s.</p>
</div>

<div class="idea">
<p class="indent2">The hapax legomena are not evenly distributed and occur in groups; most of the
occurrences are found where Paul is discussing a new subject. Almost half of the hapax legomena can
be found in the Septuagint, which Paul studied extensively. Roughly one quarter of the hapax legomena
have been identified as part of the Greek language of the time. A little over one quarter of the hapax
legomena may possibly be new Greek words to describe the new subjects associated with the new religion
of Christianity.</p>
</div>

<div class="idea">
<p class="indent2">When one studies Paul’s letters in light of his missionary journeys and experiences,
it is very difficult to see how an even distribution of vocabulary can be expected as he discusses a
variety of subjects, to Christians of a variety of ethnicities and regions, and with the variety of
situations that he writes from.</p>
<p class="indent3">In contrast to his passionate letters for Christ intended for large audiences, the
Pastoral Epistles were written to two very dear individuals. Their quiet meditative tone reflects
Paul’s love and concern for them and perhaps in context of his age and mortality.</p>
</div>

<p class="indent2">Examine the following tables of the cities he traveled to and gain a sense of some
context that his epistles were written in.</p>
<p class="indent3">Before Paul’s missionary journeys.</p>

    <td><a href="../21verses/1046.aspx" class="second">Acts 28:13-16</a><br />From his prison in Rome, Paul
      writes 4 short letters known as the <b>Prison Epistles</b>:<br /><br /><b>Ephesians</b> (approximately
      60 A.D.) – Written possibly as a circular letter to be shared among Christian assemblies around Ephesus,
      Paul wrote about the mystery of Christ. Reminding his readers of his apostolic authority, Paul shares
      his special revelation from God affirming that both Jew and Gentile form the one body of Christ; Gentile
      Believers become fellow heirs of salvation and members of the body of Christ.<br /><br /><b>Colossians</b>
      (approximately 60 A.D.) – Written to the Christians around Colossae whom he had not met before, Paul was
      responding strongly to false doctrinal teaching that was developing in the early church. Some Colossian
      members were promoting Judaism and an early form of Gnosticism. Paul emphasizes the supremacy and
      sufficiency of Christ; the Believer is complete in Christ and that Christ is in the Believer.<br /><br />
      <b>Philippians</b> (approximately 60-62 A.D.) – Paul’s letter to the Christians of Philippi is one of
      gratitude for their gift to him and joy in God. His focus is on the joy of a Christ centered life and
      their partnership in sharing the Gospel. In setting one’s mind on the high calling of God in Jesus Christ,
      differences between Christians can be overcome.<br /><br /><b>Philemon</b> (approximately 60 A.D.) –
      Considered Paul’s shortest and most personal letter, the letter to the slave owner Philemon is a lesson
      in Christian relationships; in contrast to many of his other letters, Paul does not write to correct a
      theological error or teach doctrine. And while he does not approve or condemn the practice of slavery, Paul
      crafts his exhortations with references to the Gospel. While slaves should demonstrate Christian obedience
      and humility to their masters, and Christian masters treat their slaves fairly, both slave and master are
      ontologically equal before Christ.</td>

    <td><b>1 Timothy</b> (approximately 62 A.D.) – Written to his dear disciple, Paul instructs Timothy in how
      one should conduct themselves in the church. Concerned with the importance of spiritual maturity in the
      leadership as a guard against false teaching, Paul is intent on teaching Timothy how to recognize and develop
      spiritual maturity with practical advice.<br /><br /><b>Titus</b> (approximately 63 A.D.) – Aware of the
      prevalence of false teaching, Paul advises Titus, who is a pastor on Crete, on the importance of sound doctrine
      and warns about false teachers. Paul emphasizes that belief and action are linked; right beliefs lead to right
      actions. In encouraging sound doctrine, Paul also encourages good works.</td>

      to provide his final advice to living the Christian life. Use your spiritual gifts, handle the Word of God
